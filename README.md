# Caring-Bridge
Caring Bridge is a user-friendly platform designed to bridge the gap between seniors, their families, and professional caregivers. Born out of a personal need and real-world problem, Caring Bridge aims to make the process of finding trustworthy eldercare stress-free and efficient. This is the first version of Caring Bridge, and it's currently under active development, with more features and improvements in the works.

### Overview
The platform provides a comprehensive set of features that allow families to find ideal caregivers based on their specific needs. At the same time, it gives caregivers an opportunity to showcase their skills, making it a two-sided platform that benefits both parties.

The project was built using Bootstrap, JS, React, and Flask frameworks, and features a carefully crafted UX/UI design, optimized for ease of use for our diverse user base.

Smart Matching: The platform uses an algorithm to match caregivers to families based on their specific needs and preferences.

Instant Communication: An integrated chat feature allows families and caregivers to communicate in real-time.

Secure Payments: Payments are made securely through the platform, ensuring trust and ease for both parties.
